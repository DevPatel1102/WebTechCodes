        <p><b>There are 4 schools in PDEU</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <font color="Green"><b>School of Technology</b></font>
                <p>School of Technology intends to focus on technological education, research and service that
                    anticipates, and meets, the need of tomorrowâ€™s world. It is expected that engineering graduates from
                    School of Technology will care about issues that technology can make difference whether these issues
                    are health, security, economic well-being or sustainability of world and values.</p>

                <font color="Green"><b>School of Petroleum Technology</b></font>
                <p>When the de-regulation blueprint of the Indian oil industry was announced in 1997, the world took
                    note of the enormous potential that India offered in terms of business. From a controlled field of
                    business to one where petrol and its products have been branded and are being positioned to attract
                    the maximum number of consumers, the petroleum industry has come a long way.</p>

            <br>
            <li>
                <font color="Green"><b>School of Management</b></font>
                <p>To cater to the managerial manpower requirements of the Energy and Infrastructure Sector, the
                    Management School was first established as the Institute of Petroleum Management, Gandhinagar (IPMG)
                    in 2006 by GERMI (Gujarat Energy Research and Management Institute), a trust and a society formed by
                    GSPC (Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation), a Government of Gujarat undertaking. Subsequently in
                    2007, when Pandit Deendayal Energy University (PDEU) was established by GERMI, IPMG became the
                    constituent of PDEU and changed its name to School of Petroleum Management (SPM).</p>

                <font color="Green"><b>School of Liberal Studies</b></font>
                <p>PDEU has launched School of Liberal Studies which currently offers a Bachelor degree that equips a
                    student to develop an array of intellectual skills, a variety of methodologies and ways of
                    understanding our changing world, and a broad base of varied knowledge. In turn, such a Liberal
                    Education establishes an invaluable foundation for more specialized study in one's major or in one
                    of the professions, and for a life-long affinity for learning and continuing intellectual
                    development.</p>
